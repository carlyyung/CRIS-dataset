Project title: Measuring Clinical Critical Cultural Awareness, a Sociolinguistic Analysis on Clinicians’ Language Change in Patients’ Mental Health 

This file contains a code that I have produced for my MA Big Data in Culture and Society dissertation. 
I used basic Natural Language Processing in analysising clinical data from the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) database. 

Due to the sensitive nature of this dataset, the file will not be able to run outside of the NHS network/ desktop.
